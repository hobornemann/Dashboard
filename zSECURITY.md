Web applications can be vulnerable to a variety of security issues, and it's essential for developers and organizations to be aware of these weaknesses to protect against potential threats. Here are some typical weaknesses of web applications:

1. Injection Attacks:

- SQL Injection (SQLi): Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields, manipulating a database query.
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by the victim's browser.

2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):

CSRF attacks trick users into performing actions they did not intend by exploiting the trust that a website has in the user's browser.

3. Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI):

Similar to XSS, XSSI occurs when an attacker includes an external script on a web page to steal sensitive information.

4. Security Misconfigurations:

Incorrectly configured security settings can expose sensitive information or provide unauthorized access.

5. Broken Authentication and Session Management:

Weaknesses in user authentication and session management can lead to unauthorized access, session hijacking, or session fixation.

6. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):

Occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input, allowing attackers to bypass authorization and access unauthorized data.

7. Security Headers Missing:

Lack of security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and others can expose the application to various attacks.

8. File Upload Vulnerabilities:

Insecure handling of file uploads can lead to the execution of malicious code or the upload of malicious files.

9. Insecure Dependencies:

Using outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries and components can introduce security risks.

10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards:

Attackers may manipulate URLs to redirect users to malicious websites or perform unauthorized actions.

11. Sensitive Data Exposure:

Failure to properly protect sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, can lead to data breaches.
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed 

12. Denial of Service (DDoS):

Overloading a web application with traffic or requests can lead to service disruption.

13. Security Through Obscurity:

Relying on secrecy rather than robust security measures can leave applications vulnerable.

14. XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:

Exploiting insecure XML processing can lead to disclosure of internal files or denial of service.

15. API Security Issues:

Insecure APIs can expose sensitive data and functionalities.

To mitigate these weaknesses, it's crucial to follow security best practices, conduct regular security audits and testing, and stay informed about the latest security threats and updates.
